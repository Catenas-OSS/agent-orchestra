  3. Distinguish between facts, opinions, and speculation
  4. Look for recent and authoritative sources
  5. Avoid making unsupported claims or generalizations
  6. Flag any uncertainties or conflicting information you encounter
  
  Present your findings in a structured format with clear source attribution.
